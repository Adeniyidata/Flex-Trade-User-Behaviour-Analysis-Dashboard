# Flex-Trade-User-Behaviour-Analysis-Dashboard
The "Flex- User Behaviour Analysis" project analyzes a real-world dataset containing information about the response/behaviour of users of an online shopping app dated 2023 -End of Year Report. It is used for public analysis under the permission of the company. Flex-Trade is a leading company that offers online shopping solutions. For a long time, it has been rendering effortless and enjoyable services to its customers, offering numerous products ranging from electronics to Clothing. Flex-Trade wants to keep improving its app to make sure it stays ahead in the competitive online shopping market. Even though many people download and use the Flex-Trade app, not everyone buys something. They are encountering a few problems: ● High Bounce Rate: Many users leave the app quickly without buying anything. ● Cart Abandonment: Users put items in their cart but don't complete the purchase. ● Low Average Order Value: The amount of money users spend is lower than what Flex-Trade would like. ● Lots of Competition. Many other shopping apps are out there, so Flex-Trade needs to stand out. Therefore, using the above metrics, I created a dynamic Excel dashboard to measure marketing and claim metrics/KPIs like Total User, Total Page views, Average Bounce Rate, Average Addition to Cart Rate, Average Conversion rate, Average of Session Duration and Total cart Additions so that the sales team can see the behaviour of Users in using their online shopping app. I optimised this dashboard to reveal insights and recommendations towards the actualization of the goals for the project which are to: ● Look at how users behave and what they say to find out what needs to be better. ● Make Checkout Better: Make it easier and quicker for users to buy things. ● Suggest Personalized Products: Use what we know about what users like to suggest other things they might buy. ● Get Users to Buy More: Figure out ways to encourage users to spend more money. Therefore, this project also assisted the company in achieving above 25% efficiency in optimizing their performance and how they can make their app even better for users.
